## Guidelines
There is not so much. 

Please make a specific branch for your changes. 

Comment well even if you think we don't (in this case, please let me know!).

We surely accept jQuery, but if your skilled enough to go 'vanilla' we encourage you to do so, if you're not, we strongly encourage you to visit [vanilla-js](http://www.vanilla-js.com/) website.

Code the way you like to.

- [ ] All desktop platform support
- [ ] All Cordova platform support
- [ ] Less than 1% of jQuery functions
- [ ] A realistic progress bar
